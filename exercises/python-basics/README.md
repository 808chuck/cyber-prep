# Basics of Python

# Objective

In this exercise you will walk through the basics of Python learning about various data types and logic.

# Prerequisites
- Python minimun version 2.7.13 installed
- Basic understanding of the command line
- How to run .py files

# Setup
1. Windows machines you need to install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). **Note** Mac users can skip this step as python is already installed
    - Tutorial here for reference [Installing Python Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/)
     - After setup is complete open up Command Prompt and enter the following command **python -V**. If installation was successful should see the version of python installed.
2. Create a new directory on your local machine named **python-basics**
3. Change your working directory to python-basics and create a file inside the directory named **index.py**. This is where you will be doing all your work.
